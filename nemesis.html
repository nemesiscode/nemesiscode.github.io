        <h1 class="mt-5">About NEMESIS</h1>

         NEMESIS is a general-purpose radiative transfer and retrieval code, written in FORTRAN, designed to be applicable 
         to any planetary atmosphere (solar system and exoplanets) and can handle a wide range of
         observation geometries. 
         The NEMESIS code actually has <b>three</b> components, the <b>NEMESIS</b> FORTRAN retrieval tool itself, 
		 the more general FORTRAN radiative transfer code, <b>RADTRAN</b>, from which it was developed, and the <b>ArchNEMESIS</b> 
		 Python code, derived from NEMESIS. 
        
         The Nemesis project is a collaborative effort and is continually being developed and extended. It is
         managed with Github and the repository for the FORTRAN code can be found  <a href="https://github.com/nemesiscode/radtrancode">here</a>. 
         Scientists interested in running either <b>NEMESIS</b>,  <b>RADTRAN</b> or <b>ArchNEMESIS</b> to analyse their 
         data are very welcome to contact us.

         <h1 class="mt-5">NEMESIS</h1>
         <b>NEMESIS</b>  (<b>N</b>on-linear optimal <b>E</b>stimator for <b>M</b>ultivariat<b>E</b> spectral
         analy<b>SIS</b>) is the general purpose correlated-k/LBL retrieval code developed from the
         <b>RADTRAN</b> project. The original version, developed in 2003 and used for analysing Cassini/CIRS observations of 
         Jupiter, Saturn and Titan, was based on the correlated-k approximation. However, <b>NEMESIS</b> now also now works in
         line-by-line (LBL) mode, and there is also new mode that uses pre-calculate line-by-line look-up tables.
		 NEMESIS has been designed to be generally applicable to any planet and with
         any observing mode and so is suitable for both solar-system studies and also exoplanetary studies. 

         The reference NEMESIS paper is "The NEMESIS planetary atmosphere radiative transfer and retrieval tool",

         more details please see our <a href="manuals.html">Manuals</a> page.


         <h1 class="mt-5">RADTRAN</h1>
         <b>RADTRAN</b> is a general purpose FORTRAN planetary radiative transfer model for computing 
         the transmission of atmospheric paths and/or the radiances emitted by 
         planetary atmospheres. The code is general purpose and not hard-wired to any
         specific planet. <b>RADTRAN</b> evolved from <b>Genlbl</b>, which was a general purpose
         planetary line-by-line model, developed by Dr Simon Calcutt. <b>RADTRAN</b> extended
         the functionality of this program to also allow the computation of planetary
         spectra using both band model approximations and also the correlated-k 
         approximation. The code has also been extended to incorporate both multiple 
         scattering and single scattering calculations. For
         more details please see our <a href="manuals.html">Manuals</a> page.

         <h1 class="mt-5">Why is it called NEMESIS?</h1>

         Nemesis is traditionally known as the Goddess of Vengeance and Retribution. 
         Some authors connect the name with “to feel just resentment” or “righteous anger”. 
         However, the word Nemesis originally meant the distributor of fortune, whether 
         good or bad, in due proportion to each man according to his deserts.
         <p>
 	 <p>
<!--       In Greek mythology Nemesis was the daughter of Nyx the primordial goddess 
         of the night. Nyx was born of Chaos. She gave birth to Aether alone and 
         Hemera, Moros, Charon, Eros and the Keres with her brother, Erebus. With 
         Dionysus, she mothered Phthonus. Apart from Nemesis, Nyx was also mother 
         of Momus, Thanatos, Hypnos, the Hesperides, Apate, Philotes, and Geras - the Fates.
         <p>
         Nemesis is said to have been as beautiful as Aphrodite and was seduced by Zeus in 
         the form of a swan. The Goddess of Punishment, Poena, was an attendant of Nemesis.
-->
         <p>
         As Nemesis/Fortuna, a conflation of the Greek deity of fate with the Roman Fortuna, 
         she was perceived not as bringer of retribution, but as having the power of changing 
         fortune. Hence, she was an ideal deity to make patron goddess of gladiators. It is
         thought that gladiators made offerings to this “goddess of fortune” before fighting 
         in the Roman arenas. It is the “goddess of fortune” view of Nemesis, which inspired 
         the naming of this retrieval code in her honour. It is hoped that Nemesis will bring 
         good fortune and will considerably improve the retrieval of atmospheric properties 
         from remotely-sensed infrared planetary spectra.
